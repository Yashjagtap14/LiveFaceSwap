LiveFaceSwap

A real-time face swap using OpenCV that lets you swap faces directly from your webcam, with a focus on "Deepfake awareness and security implications".  
This project demonstrates computer vision techniques while highlighting potential risks in facial recognition systems and identity spoofing.

🚀 Features

🎥 Real-time face swap using your webcam  
🖼 Supports custom face images  
✨ Smooth blending with OpenCV’s seamlessClone  
😎 Beginner-friendly: press Q to quit anytime   

🔧 How It Works

1. *Input* – webcam feed  
2. *Detector* – OpenCV detects faces  
3. *Resizer* – scales swap image to match detected faces  
4. *Blender* – applies seamless clone for smooth overlay  
5. *Output* – live face-swapped webcam feed  

⚠ Security Awareness

- Demonstrates how *easy it is to manipulate faces* in images or videos.  
- Can be used to *simulate attacks on facial recognition systems* for learning purposes.  
- Raises awareness about *identity spoofing and deepfake risks*.  

 🔮 Future Enhancements
 
✅ Support for video files  
✅ Lightweight GUI  

💡 Learning Outcomes
  
- Understanding security implications of deepfakes and facial spoofing  
- Awareness about digital identity protection  

📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV
